### The Problem
<img style="float: right;" src="cat-5618328_1920.jpg">
  Outdoor housecats are a common sight in cities and suburbs throughout the United States. We like to allow our feline friends the freedom to do as they wish. Cats are solitary and independent animals, so it only makes sense that we let them roam freely; trusting, of course, they come back to eat.

Despite us cat owners (typically) having the best intention at heart, by introducing our feline companions to an entirely unprepared ecosystem, we have allowed a major ecological catastrophy to unfold; bird extinctions and foodchain disruptions are just the tip of the iceberg.

### It isn't just feral cats
  When it comes to predation, there isn't much difference between a domesticated cat roaming freely outdoors and a feral cat with no definite home. Cats are predators by nature and will hunt for more than just sustenance. Beyond that, un-neutered outdoor cats (whether or not they are feral) inevitibly contribute to a growing feral cat population.

### Rectification Attempts
  In order to design and propse an adequate solution, first we have to know what ongoing attempts at remediation have been, or are being undertaken.

#### Trap and Return (TNR)
  By far the most common approach to our ecological delimma, TNR is a very simple (and comparatively ethical) solution to reduce feral cat population. As the name would suggest, TNR projects seek to trap outdoor cats (usually feral, sometimes domestic), neuter/spay them, and either return them back to the "suburban wild," or house them in local animal shelters to await adoption. Unfortunately, this approach is only as effective as its implementation. According to [a study published by the University of California Davis](https://jyjones2.github.io/outdoor-cats-and-ecology/sources), TNR projects tend to lack effectiveness across the board, due to poor implementation and ill-defined goals. Additionally, TNR projects keep very poor record of their own effectiveness, leading to insufficient data.

#### Poison Baiting and Hunting
  As inhumane as it may seem, many communities around the world have resorted to poison baiting. For example, [according to the government of Australia](https://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive-species/feral-animals-australia/feral-cats), feral cats have been allowed to cause so much damage, that they are now officially declared invasive pests. It goes without saying that once an animal is declared a pest, all bets are off in regards to the expectation of ethical or humane treatment. By their very nature, both huting and (especially) poison baiting, are incredibly effective means of controling an otherwise out-of-control cat population. Ultimately, by virtue of our inaction, we have necessitated hostile and inhumane intervention in order to mitigate the damaged caused by our negligent introduction of such a predacious species.

### The Time to Act is Now
  If you love cats like I do, you should be very upset after reading the previous section. Not at the government of Australia (or any other government with similar policies for that matter), but at our own mistakes that lead to the necessity of decimating one population to save another. 

#### Educate Your Community!
  Ultimately, while it may be a noble goal to board a plane to a major city where cats roam freely, it is far more reasonable to address this problem in your local community. First, I believe education is critical to resolve this problem. In my own personal experience discussing this issue, the majority of people I spoke with were entirely unaware this problem even existed! Beyond that, many (I would wager _most_) pet owners are also animal lovers in a general sense; if they knew the harm that outdoor cats cause on other wildlife, they would definitely think twice before letting Mittens roam freely.

#### Get Involved!
  Have you ever been sitting outside or looking out the window, only to see a stray cat saunter freely down the street? It may not necessarily be safe to approach the cat, but that doesn't mean you should ignore it. Take out a pen and paper and write down what you saw - what color, how big was it, did it have a collar, etc. If you've seen it more than once, try and write down the time of day and where it was. This information will be invalueble to local shelters, as they typically have the eqipment to safely catch the roaming feline and, depending on who owns it, either spay/neuter it or return it to its owner. 

#### Don't Be Part of the Problem; Be Part of the Solution!
- Spay and neuter your cats. Even if you don't have a free-roaming cat, it is important to spay/neuter them. Should they ever get out, it only takes one chance meeting with another cat to increase the outdoor population ten-fold
- If you want your cat to spend time outdoors, consider putting together a small, fenced-in area for them to play freely while still remaining contained. Not only does this decrease the risk of them acting on their predatory nature, but it also reduces the likelyhood that they will suffer due to man-made environmental hazards (ex: cars and trucks). 
 
#### Addressing some common rebuttals
##### Cats deserve abject independence; it's part of their nature
  As briefly touched on above, cat owners can typically be identified by their love of cats and their fierce opinions. For this reason, many of us believe that cats should be allowed to roam freely; as if anything less would be unethical in and of itself. According to Dr. Nico Dauphin√© and Dr. Robert Cooper in their study titled ["Pick one: Outdoor Cats or Conservation"](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nico_Dauphine/publication/288947356_Pick_one_outdoor_cats_or_conservation/links/581a340e08aeffb294131773/Pick-one-outdoor-cats-or-conservation.pdf), they provide reference to several studies which concluded that feral outdoor cats suffer an average 80% mortality rate, along with an average lifespan of 2 years. Obviously, this is in reference to feral cats, but many of the causes of mortality (vehicles, bigger predators, weather) affect outdoor cats whether they are owned or not.  
  Independence is important to human beings, but if I were to allow a toddler free-reign to a blowtorch and a bundle of fireworks, you would start to seriously question my parental abilities. The responsibility we take on when we adopt an animal includes protecting them from dangers they cannot comprehend. I believe that this includes keeping them indoors, as it significantly reduces the risk of injury or death. 

##### Taking away an animal's ability to reproduce is unethical
  Some cat owners (really, animal owners in general) oppose the idea of spaying and (specifically) neutering. This usually comes down to the idea that they are reducing or harming the identity of their animal in a way that they (the owner) would feel ashamed of, were it to happen to them personally. I understand the sentiment but I have to make a critical point in opposition: cats are animals. Sure, you may quantify humans as animals, but we have the capacity to reason through complex logic. An animal does not understand the concequences of introducing life into the world, beyond its own internalized biological need. I cannot tell my cat to save up enough money before committing to having kittens. Beyond that, even if you believe that you can keep a watchful eye on your cat 100% of the time (when they're around cats of the opposite gener), the process of spaying and neutering reduces cancer risk significantly.
