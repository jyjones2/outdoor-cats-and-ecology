# The Effects of Outdoor Cats on The Ecosystem

### Cats are wonderful animals 
Unfortunately, we
may be letting them have too
much freedom outside the
house. We have yet to
properly address and repair the ecological impact of both domestic and feral outdoor
cats. According to the
American Veterinary
Medical Association (via
the Washington Post), as
of 2016 approximately
38% of American
households are home to at
least one cat. We as a
species care very much
about our companion
animals, so much so that
our conversations about
their wellbeing can
become quite heated.
Unfortunately, in many
contentious debates, science finds itself taking a back-seat to emotionally charged
discourse.


**_The Problem_**

When thinking about cats, it is
likely that one of the first thoughts to
pop into your head is in some way
related to hunting proficiency. Cats
typically target smaller rodents or
birds and while that may be
convenient for some homeowners, it
can have devastating consequences.
According to Dauphine and Cooper
(“Pick One: Outdoor Cats or
Conservation”), domestic cats make
up one of the largest threats to endangered bird species, having been estimated to have
contributed to approximately ​ **33 bird extinctions** ​. The extinction of animals critical to
the food chain leads to further compounding problems down the road, beyond just the
loss of a species.​ ​To go even further, just because a local cat may not be causing a
literal species extinction, local environments suffer whenever they are disrupted by an
invasive predator. The graph on the left
is an excellent illustration of how
large-scale this issue is. With the
median probability distribution for bird
deaths due to free-ranging cats lying at
roughly 2.4 billion birds killed, not to
mention the median number of small
_mammal_ ​ deaths being upwards of 12
billion.
It is quite easy to forget that
many of our companion animals (dogs,
cats, rats, etc) are descended from wild
animals and thus have a “genetically
embedded” hunting instinct. As with
many ecological issues, the root cause
does not lie with (in this case) the cats,
but rather with our methods of
guardianship.

**_The problem still persists_**

The environmental and ecological impact of
outdoor, free-roaming cats is not a new discovery.
Over 100 years ago, scientific minds were already
drawing attention to the impact that cats have on
local ecosystems (Hadidian, J., Gibson, I., Hagood,
S., Peterson, N., Unti, B., McFarland, B., ... &
Fearing, J. ). Our failure to act has led to the
problem rising to the point that it can no
longer be ignored.
In order to understand the scope of this
issue, we have to briefly touch on why, in our
modern day, it is still a problem. It is scientifically
established that cats are causing enough of an
impact to warrant focused intervention. By far the
most common tool in the “ecological arsenal” is
called ​ **“Trap, Neuter, Release”** ​ (sometimes referred to as “Trap, Neuter, Return” - ​ **TNR**
for short). TNR is a fairly self-explanatory concept; the driving force behind the entire
issue is that unneutered outdoor cats lead to exponentially ​ _more_ ​unneutered outdoor
cats; effectively, outdoor (or otherwise unmanaged) cats are trapped, neutered, and
returned to their environment. This practice began in the 1970s in Europe, lauded as a
much more humane approach as opposed to trapping and killing (​ _Hadidian, J., Gibson,
I., Hagood, S., Peterson, N., Unti, B., McFarland, B., ... & Fearing, J._ ​).

While TNR may be the dominantly used method, it is not without its own
problems. According to a study published by the University of California, Davis (​ _Boone,
J. D, Briggs, J. R, Hiby, E., Lawler, D. F, Levy, J. K, Miller, P. S, et al_ ​), the effectiveness
of TNR rests in the hands of its implementation - not the concept. The study goes on to
say that in many cases, when TNR efforts are organized they typically do not clearly
delineate the desired outcome of the effort using a meaningful measure. This makes it
very difficult to gauge the efficacy of TNR and practically calls the entire practice into
question.

**_What about the cats themselves?_**

When we evaluate this problem purely based on numbers and
statistics, it can be difficult to remember the animal “causing” the problem
also deserves ethical consideration.


**_What about the cats themselves? Contd,.._**

As mentioned previously, the practice of TNR came about specifically due to the
ethical concerns of mass cat-cullings. We may tend to view our nimble mousers as
independent, self-sufficient hunters, domestic cats are still just that - domestic.
According to Dr. Nico Dauphiné and Dr. Robert Cooper in “Pick One: Outdoor Cats or
Conservation,” in most cases, outdoor cats do not live happy lives. Speaking specifically
in regards to feral cats, in some areas they suffer from a mortality rate of nearly ​ **_eighty
percent_** ​.
It is easy to dismiss this statistic as it is in reference to specifically ​ _feral_ ​cats,
but ultimately the only difference between a feral cat and a domestic cat is a loving
home. Beyond that, unneutered, outdoor domestic cats can lead to an increased feral
cat population. In addition to natural threats like disease, feral and outdoor domestic
cats alike contend with human-created threats, such as busy roads. Additionally,
outdoor cats are often viewed as a local nuisance, leading to humans (effectively)
hunting them as a means to curb their population.

**_The Unfortunate Reality_**

While many people are working diligently to not only control out-of-control
outdoor cat populations in a humane, non-lethal way, the problem has become bad
enough in some areas that some groups have deemed it a necessity to take harsher,
more lethal action. In the country of Australia, a nation full of many animals both big and
small that potentially fall prey to felis catus, this lethal action has been put into practice
by the government itself.

According to the Australian
Government Department of
Agriculture, Water, and the
Environment, cats have been
officially declared as pests. This
declaration effectively removes any
barriers related to humane
population control, and allows local
officials to take “whatever actions
they deem necessary” to stop the
problem. The most effective
measure taken thus far, and therefore the most popular, has been poison baiting.


**_Conclusion_**

Arguably the most important takeaway when discussing this issue, like with many
other ecological issues, is that our lack of expediency in intervention, coupled with our
introduction of the problem in the first place, has led us to where we are now. ​ **Cats are
not even native to Australia** ​, and yet they must suffer the consequences of our
misdeeds. As the most developed of the species living on this planet, we have our own
obligation to maintain the welfare of our native flora and fauna, but unfortunately we
have backed ourselves into a corner - our moral obligation to prevent the extinction of
many birds and native animals on one side, diametrically opposed to the necessity of
lethal intervention; debating (and undertake) the necessity of killing droves of a
population that we caused to become a problem.
